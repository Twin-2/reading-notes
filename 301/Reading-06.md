### Node.js
[Node is](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/):
> JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

The Chrome V8 engine
- it is what compiles JS down to machine code for your computer to read.
- Node, being built on this, can run on any computer to translate between JS and machine code.

Insatlling node
- you can use a version control to run multiple versions of Node.
- [Look Here](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/) for more info on version control

Node
- you can use node to run JS directly in your command line. 
- Node supports ES6
- npm" Node Package Manager
  - npm i -g for global install
  - you can also install locally.
- 'node_modules' holds all libraries that are needed to run your program. 
  - npm install within the root folder will install all node_modules

Node and the Server
- node allows for higher performance and can help to stop site crashes by itssingle threaded, even driven nature
- node combines callbackf functions into server requests to keep a single thread going. 

**Node is best for apps that want some real-time interaction**

### Pair Programming
Pair programming is essentially: two programmers working on a project together

How does it work?
- two roles: the Driver and the Navigator
  - Driver: the one with hands on the keyboard.
  - [Navigator](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/) uses words to guide the Driver but doe snot directly touch the computer

Why do it?
- helps with learning a language through 4 methods:
   1. Listening
   2. Speaking
   3. Reading
   4. Writing

Reasons to use it:
1. Greater efficiency
    - may take longer but the quality is better saving time and money with bug fixes.
    - easier to catch errors as they are written than as a big
    - improves team skills
2. Engaged collaboration
    - easier to stay on task with an accoutability partner
    - encourages asking for help
3. Learning from your fellow students
    - yuo get to see how others think which will give you new ideas
4. Social skills
    - imporve your communication and other social skills by having to work with others.
5. Job interview rediness
    - many applications will involve pair programming
6. Work environment readiness
    - most work environments use pair programming so you might as well get used to it now!

    - Two people work together to produce code faster and more accurately through communication and collaboration. 


## Things I want to know more about
API's.
The concept of a server. There is so much on the back end that is all theoredical and I can't see so it is hard for me to understand. I am a very visual learner so I think this topic will be hard for me.
