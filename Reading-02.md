# Warm up with CSS
CSS: use 'vw' for sizing, especially with text.
- 'display-inline block' for lining things up.
- use Flex-box for structuring.

# React state and Props

## Create-react-app command
- create react app is a starting point for scaffolding
- the most important file in node.js is 'package.json'
  - hold dependancies; needed files for the program to run.
  - each itme would need to be individually downloaded if not running create-react-app
- node modules
  - everything gets installed into node_modules
  - each module that you install has it's own modules that needed to be installed... all that goes into nde_modules
  - running 'npm i' looks in 'package.json' and installs all the node_modules
## React

**React is not the thing you put on the internet**.

React uses JSX to create HTML and JS that is put on the internet.







# Command lines
  - npm i
  - create-react-app
  - npm run build: 'build' an HTML index file that can be put online.
