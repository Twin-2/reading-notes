## Project Dragonfly

In 2018, it came out that Google was working on a project to allow government censorshipof content. This was designed for the chineese government in the hopes that Google would be able to expand business to the country. Other large ttech companies have explored this path and each time there has been huge public and internal backlash, to the point that the projects were disbanded. Issues like this have brought up the conversation of a CEO and for profit company's responsibility to make money for the shareholders. However, it seems to be the common consensus that this is not acceptable at the cost of human rights violations.

## Ethics of self-driving cars

This topic got a lot more crazy than i expected!!! The first and biggest issue is the moral ethics of a no win situation. It will inevitably happen, so what is the car programmed to do? Kill the baby but save the 2 adults? Kill the driver but save a pedistrian? Even though self-driving vehicles WILL savea tone of lives by eliminating human error, there are still these crazy scenarios that must be accoutned for. Based on the article, it sounds like the tech and automobile companies are waiting on governement to decide the appropriate ethics and then program the cars accordingly. Who knows, maybe there will even be differnt laws in differnt states that your car will have to know and adapt to.
