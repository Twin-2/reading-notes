# Super Matio Effect

Thinking of learning as success or failure can hinder your own learning.

Learn from but do not focus on the your failures.

Your feelings of satisfaction and accomplishments come from the difficulty of pushing through failures to finally succeed.

# The JS Event Loop

The call stack on JS in single threaded so it can only run one line of code at a time.

Butnot really... the run time can only do one thing at a time but there is a stack (single thread) and then the callback queue holds all the async functions. Once the stack is empty then the event loop puts items fron the callback onto the stack.

# The 5 Why's

Ask 'why' up to 5 times.

This gets down to the root issue not just the symptoms that are showing.

# How to think like a programmer

Most problem solving is trial and error. This takes a long time and waists time. to think like a Programmer you need to take a different approach
- have a framework
- practice it

### the Framework
1. **Understand** what is being asked
    - use the Dan Pink rubber duck solutiuon.
2. Plan
    - write out the steps of your solution
    - use comments in code to write out all the steps.
3. Divide
    - Break the big issue into little ones. 
    - each "sub-problem" should be simple and not rely on other solutions. 
    - if you still find yourself stuck, **reduce the problem**.
4. Stuck?
    - Google

### Practice


# Pretend your time is worth $1000 per hour

This article is about the simple concept of taking controll/ownership of your time.

Being busy is not the goal with this concept. Just being busy is not enough. It's about being **productive**

Say no more. And say no to things that are not important.

# How to solve programming problems

'Measure twice, cut once' => plan, then code.

>1. Read the problem completely twice.
>2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
>3. Optimize the manual steps.
>4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
>5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
>6. Optimize the real code.
