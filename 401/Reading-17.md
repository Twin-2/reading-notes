# Review, Research, and Discussion

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1. Describe “The Cloud”
    1. Servers accessed over the internet rather than on a local machine. [Reading](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)
2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
    1. It is the unit of code that has been packaged up by one machine to be sent to another.
3. What is auto-scaling?
    1. It is the ability of a service to scale accorrding to the needs rathern than having set limits. AWS does this for example.
4. What is bandwidth?
    1. A measure of how much data can be transfered over time.
5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
    1. Everyone does it differently. AWS uses a scaling aproach where they will charge you based on how much service you need. Other might only give you so much usage and then your server will crash (think of the times when you've heard of a website crashing from to omuch sudden traffic).

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances: in terms of deployment -> each deployment becomes an instance of the server. Each has it's own domain, settings, and config.
- Containers: the units of data that is passed between macnihes in the OSI model.
- Cloud Services: services that make applications easier to maintain and deploy, all managed by a 3rd party system on their hubs and servers.
- Cloud Architecture:
- AWS: Amazon web services (cloud services). You can do a variety of things from deploying to analytics with AWS.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Heroku is a static scale of deployment. AWS Beanstalk is dynamic and auto-scaling.

Preview

    - The cloud!
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

    - Lambda functions
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

    - Lambda functions! I'm eager to be able to use them to plug together different resources on AWS.
