# Lecture - Testing

Never test against a live API for front end dev testing.

When testing we set up a fake API with msw

Not Unit tests, **behavioral** tests

- find things in the dom, emulate a click on something, emulate what would happen on that click.

## useReducer()

operates very similarly to the reduce array method

very complicated... But really good when action/changes to state become more complicated.

## Things I want to know more about

useCallback, useMemo
