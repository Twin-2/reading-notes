### Linked List
Definition:
- group of individual **Nodes** that each point to the next.
- they are a linear data structure


References:
- singly -- only points to one node
- doubly -- points to two nodes, before and after.

Nodes:
- contain the data of the list
- has a prop called next -> point to nest link

Types:
- Head: first node
- Current: currently being looked at node

Oder of operations is very important with linked lists.

memory storage: unlike arrays, LL do not need to be binarily stored next to each other. 

#### Traversal
while loops are great to continue to loop as long as there is a next property

Big O of O(1) or O(n) depending on if we are inserting at the beginning or end of the list. 

#### When to use?

>a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
