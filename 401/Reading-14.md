# Assignment Questions

Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- they are the same. A standard queue works on the FIFO principle. 
2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- distributed asynchronous architecture pattern.
4. How do you test an event driven system?

- FIFO Queue: it follows the First In First Out principle meaning that as data enters the queue it will be processed and output in the order that it came in. 
- Pub/Sub: a way to handle asynchronous processing in event driven programming.

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
