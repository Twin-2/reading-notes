## Things I want to know more about
syntax and structure of react compnents. I feel that I am missing something on the syntax. I don't know how to identify what is a keywork.

Which elements are the props? Is it text after render?

Do all components extend React.component?

What is the difference between render and return in a React component?

Do classes have thier own scope just like function keyword?


### Day 1

#### Pre reading on React
immutability- not changing the original values of objects/arrays, instead creating a new array with the new values.
  this creats better usability.
  
components = large building blocks of code.

state = instance of each component.

class =

call variables in JSX by using {}. You can put any JS in {}.

if an element is empty, use '/' to close it right away. Or you can have children inside it. Ex:

> const element = "\<img src={user.avatarUrl} />;"
> const element = (\<div> \<h1>Hello!</h1> \<h2>Good to see you here.</h2> \</div>);

elements are the smallest compnent of react. think of them like objects.

**Think about how the UI should look at any one poipnt, not how you want to change it.**

The simplest form of a component is a function.

**All react compnets must act like pure functions with respect to their porps.**

Changing a react function to a react class:
1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

- Mounting and unmounting: the first rendering to the DOM is mounting and taking it off the DOM is unmounting.
  - componentDidMount(), componentWillUnmount().

### React Handling Events

Event listeners are typed in camel case in JSX

It is important to "bind" this in callback function so that this is not undefined. Use this._____.bind

### Lists and Keys

Put the keps in the map() function.

### Thinking in React

When building apps in react, start by building a **static** model. then add interactibility later. 
  - Do not use state for the static model, use only props instead

When building large products, start at the bottom.

When building small projects, start at the top.

Strategy for identifying where state should go:
- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you canâ€™t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### Adding dynamic levels to your code

you can make things \(like className) dynamic by creating a new object withing the function and do something like += to the string that is it's name. 


## Day 1 lecture

### Backgrounds

- 7-8 years teaching, 6 years at CF
- No college education, went through "imposter syndrome"


- Software engineer: these skills are learned in 301
- 301 about the usage of tools, but you have to learn how to use said tools.
- NOT ABOUT being an excilent programmer, About being an engineer, understanding architecture.

- Lectures: want to grasp core concepts to set up for lab and set up for lab.

CF Mission: tech skills for a bette life, for a better community, and for a better world.
- other backgrounds are good in coding. 
- learn to translate those skills into this new environemnt

CF Mission: We guide people from all backgrounds to change thier lives through fast-pasted, career-focused education. We shape passionate learners with immersive training to meet industry needs and improve diversity. 
- is fast paced
- passionate learners, sharing with others

### React lecture

**Readings are for surface level understanind**

#### Daily structure

1. Morning
- Warm up 5-10min
- Code review 15-45min
- Main topic ~2 hours
- Lab prep 5-10min

2. Afternoon
- 1-2/3pm for Code challenge
- 2/3-6pm lab **priority**

## React JS

React is a **library** but acts somewhat like a framework
- Declaarative programming: declare something and it does it.
- Component based

- Extending classes
  - must use super(props) in new constructor function to call in previous constructor function

Node.js runs off the global object not the window object.
