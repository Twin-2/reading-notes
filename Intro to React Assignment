1. What is a component?
Codied definition on a compnent from [Reading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
>A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
>A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.
>A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.
Paraphrased definition in my own workds:
>A component is the building block of a webpage. Each component encompasses one complete aspect and is designed to be easily reusable. Components can be treated like objects but are often larger files with potentially more content in them.
